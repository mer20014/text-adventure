# Overview
This program was made to help learn Java. 

It is a text-based adventure game inspired by a mystery in monster of the week.
You play as a hunter working for the Usher Foundation. There's a report of a town having bizzare encounters. Tasked with
investigating it, you do some research and decide the best course of action to take to prevent anything else from happening.

I used the first two videos in a youtube tutorial to start the structure of my game. From there, I created everything else myself.
I also used a lot of tutorials on Java, the most helpful of which will also be linked below.
